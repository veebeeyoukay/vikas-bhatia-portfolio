This proposal outlines my vision for Zenity's security program, addressing both immediate needs and long-term objectives to support your continued growth and market leadership in AI Agent security.

## Zenity Company History

Zenity began its journey four years ago with a clear focus on protecting low-code/no-code environments, particularly integrating with platforms like Power BI. Founded by two former Microsoft leaders—Ben Kliger (CEO, now based in New York) and Michael Bargury (CTO, based in Israel)—the company has demonstrated remarkable adaptability as the market evolved.

As low-code/no-code platforms expanded beyond Power BI to include technologies like Copilot Studio, Zenity evolved its security focus accordingly. Today, the company stands as a leader in securing agentic AI, providing the governance and visibility that enterprises need to safely adopt these transformative technologies.

With approximately 100 team members and over $55 million in total funding, including a $38 million Series B round led by Third Point Ventures and DTCP, Zenity has established itself as a well-funded, rapidly growing security innovator. Strategic investments from Microsoft's M12 venture arm and Intel Capital further validate Zenity's market position and technology approach.

The company has successfully attracted enterprise customers including Microsoft and American Express, positioning itself in a high-growth market segment with significant acquisition potential in the next 12-18 months.

## Zenity Business Objectives

Zenity's business objectives center on establishing market leadership in AI Agent security while driving enterprise adoption and revenue growth:

1. **Enterprise Customer Acquisition**: Expand the customer base among Fortune 500 companies seeking to secure their AI Agent implementations, with particular focus on financial services, technology, and other regulated industries.

2. **Sales Cycle Acceleration**: Remove security barriers that currently slow enterprise sales cycles, enabling faster deal closure with large organizations that have rigorous security requirements.

3. **Product Leadership**: Maintain technical leadership in AI Agent security through continued innovation and research, building on existing strengths in identifying and mitigating emerging threats.

4. **Microsoft Ecosystem Integration**: Deepen integration with Microsoft's Copilot ecosystem, leveraging the strategic relationship with Microsoft to expand market reach.

5. **Operational Scaling**: Scale internal operations to support rapid growth while maintaining the agility and innovation culture of a startup.

6. **Strategic Positioning**: Enhance company valuation and strategic positioning for potential acquisition within the next 12-18 months.

7. **Security Credibility**: Establish Zenity as the trusted security partner for enterprises implementing AI Agents, with a reputation for both technical excellence and practical business enablement.

## Zenity Leadership Objectives

### Make Zenity More Secure and Robust
Zenity's leadership seeks to establish a comprehensive security foundation that protects both internal operations and customer data. This includes implementing fundamental security policies, procedures, and controls that align with enterprise expectations while maintaining the agility needed for continued innovation.

### Implement Hands-On Security Leadership
The ideal security approach combines technical depth with practical execution. Leadership requires a CISO with an engineering mindset who can personally implement security solutions while also managing GRC requirements—someone who builds rather than just directs.

### Own Enterprise Security Reviews
With customers like Microsoft and American Express, Zenity needs security leadership that can confidently navigate complex enterprise security reviews. This means anticipating requirements, preparing comprehensive documentation, and representing Zenity's security posture with authority and credibility.

### Establish a Comprehensive Security Program
Leadership envisions a structured security program that addresses both immediate needs and long-term objectives. This program must be clearly communicated to customers, providing confidence that Zenity takes security seriously while enabling rather than blocking business growth.

### Enable Global Collaboration
With leadership split between New York and Israel, the East Coast location requirement ensures effective collaboration across time zones. This geographical alignment supports seamless communication between security leadership and the technical team in Israel.
