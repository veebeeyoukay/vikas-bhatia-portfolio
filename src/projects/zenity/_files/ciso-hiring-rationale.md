## Executive Summary

As the CEO of Zenity following our successful $38M Series B funding round, hiring a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) represents a strategic imperative for our organization. This document outlines the business rationale for this critical hire and defines the specific qualifications we require to support our next growth phase in the AI Agent and low-code/no-code security governance space.

## Business Context & Rationale

### 1. Critical Growth Inflection Point

Zenity has secured $38 million in Series B funding co-led by Third Point Ventures and DTCP, pushing our total capital raised to over $55 million. This follows strategic investment from Microsoft's venture arm M12, with continued support from existing investors Intel Capital and Vertex Ventures. This significant capital infusion marks a critical inflection point in our company's trajectory, necessitating mature security leadership.

### 2. Market Position Demands Credibility

As the "world's first and only governance and security solution for low-code/no-code applications and platforms," Zenity's core business is helping organizations implement security governance for citizen development. Our platform has evolved to address AI Agent security through unified AI Observability, AI Security Posture Management (AISPM), and AI Detection & Response (AIDR) capabilities. Our leadership position in security governance requires us to demonstrate impeccable internal security practices.

### 3. Enterprise Customer Expansion

Our Series B funding aims to accelerate and expand our ability to enable AI apps and agents among Fortune 500 enterprises, including current customers across financial services, technology, manufacturing, energy and pharmaceutical industries. These enterprise customers have rigorous security requirements for their vendors, making a CISO essential for sales enablement and customer trust.

### 4. Compliance & Risk Framework Development

Research shows that the average large enterprise has nearly 80,000 AI agents, apps, and automations built using low-code platforms, with over 62% containing security vulnerabilities. Our CTO recently presented research at Black Hat 2024 revealing how easily bad actors can take control over enterprise copilots. As we scale, we need a CISO to develop comprehensive compliance and risk frameworks that align with our rapidly evolving technology stack and customer needs.

### 5. Partner Program & Ecosystem Expansion

The funding will support launching a partner program to expand our ecosystem of supporting enterprises globally as they adopt agentic workflows. With Forbes estimating more than 51% of companies actively adopting AI for process automation, security concerns remain the primary barrier to full implementation for many organizations. A CISO will be instrumental in building security-focused partnerships and alliances.

## Why Hire a CISO After Series B Funding?

As Zenity's CEO, my timing for hiring a CISO at this specific growth stage is strategic for several critical reasons:

1. **Enterprise Security Credibility Gap**: While we provide security governance solutions, we've reached a scale where enterprise prospects expect our internal security practices to be exemplary. A CISO hire signals our commitment to security excellence and addresses the "physician, heal thyself" challenge.

2. **Growth-Stage Risk Inflection Point**: Our rapid growth from Series B funding ($38M) exposes us to new levels of security and compliance risk. Customer data volume is increasing, our development team is expanding, and our product capabilities are growing more sophisticated. These factors create significant new attack surfaces we must systematically protect.

3. **Security as a Revenue Driver**: Enterprise security assessments and compliance requirements are becoming friction points in our sales cycle. A CISO will transform security from a potential sales blocker to a competitive advantage by establishing frameworks that accelerate sales to security-conscious organizations.

4. **AI Security Innovation Leadership**: As we expand our AI Agent security offerings, we need an executive security voice to participate in emerging AI security standards development and thought leadership, positioning Zenity as the trusted authority in this rapidly evolving space.

5. **Investor Risk Management Expectations**: Our Series B investors expect mature governance and risk management processes as we scale toward a potential future exit. A CISO delivers the security governance structures that protect their investment and prepare us for future funding rounds.

## Alignment with Security Standards

This CISO hiring initiative aligns with key security framework requirements:

- **ISO 27001:2022**: Clause 5.1 (Leadership and commitment), 5.2 (Security policy), and 5.3 (Organizational roles, responsibilities, and authorities)
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**: PM-2 (Information Security Program Leadership Role) and PM-30 (Supply Chain Risk Management Strategy)
- **NIST AI RMF**: GOVERN 1.2 (Define AI risk management roles and responsibilities)
