# Expanded Key Points from Jon Wallace Interview

## Company Evolution and Current State

Zenity began as a security solution for low-code/no-code environments four years ago, focusing initially on platforms like Power BI. The company has strategically evolved alongside the market, expanding its focus to include Copilot Studio and now positioning itself as a leader in securing agentic AI. This evolution demonstrates the founders' ability to anticipate market shifts and pivot accordingly.

The company maintains a startup mentality but with the stability of a well-established organization. With approximately 100 employees and over $55 million in funding (including a recent $38 million Series B round), Zenity has achieved significant market traction while maintaining the agility to adapt to emerging security challenges.

Jon Wallace specifically mentioned that Zenity is "well-funded" and "not at risk of going out of business next month," indicating financial stability despite the startup culture. He also candidly shared his belief that the company will likely be acquired within the next 12-18 months, highlighting the strategic value of Zenity's position in the AI security market.

## Immediate Security Challenges

The conversation revealed several urgent security challenges that require immediate attention:

1. **Lack of Basic Security Policies**: Jon explicitly mentioned the absence of fundamental policies such as log retention, stating "we don't actually have a log retention policy" and lacking clarity on whether logs are kept for "3 months, 6 months" or another timeframe.

2. **Ad-hoc Security Response Process**: When security questionnaires arrive from enterprise customers like Microsoft, there is no defined process. These inquiries currently go to Michael (CTO), who is "completely snowed under" and forwards them to Jon, who acknowledges he's "not the right person" and has "other priorities."

3. **Enterprise Sales Bottlenecks**: Jon described a specific scenario with American Express where Zenity's sales team successfully generated interest and secured a champion, but the deal stalled at the security review stage. As Jon colorfully put it, "we're in a fucking mess right now" regarding their ability to satisfy enterprise security requirements.

4. **Technical Debt**: The conversation implied significant technical debt in security infrastructure, with Jon emphasizing the need to bring "a level of sanity to our internal security."

5. **Resource Constraints**: Jon emphasized that this is a hands-on role where the CISO will need to personally implement solutions rather than delegate, stating they're "not looking for someone who wants to come on with the intention of hiring people to do those functions."

## CISO Role Expectations

The interview revealed multifaceted expectations for the CISO role:

1. **Dual Focus**: Jon clearly articulated two main functions: managing internal security and handling GRC/customer-facing security requirements. Both aspects were presented as equally important.

2. **Hands-on Implementation**: Jon repeatedly emphasized the need for someone with a "hands-on developer mindset" who can personally implement solutions rather than just direct others. He contrasted this with a previous candidate who responded to technical questions with "whoever we assigned to that."

3. **Enterprise Security Enablement**: A significant portion of the role involves enabling enterprise sales by satisfying security requirements from companies like Microsoft and American Express. Jon described how champions within these organizations "have absolutely zero authority to override the security team," making the CISO's ability to navigate enterprise security reviews critical to revenue.

4. **Technical Credibility with CTO**: Jon mentioned that Michael Bargury, the CTO, is "very, very technical, especially with security" and has "Black Hat presentations about hacking AI agents." The CISO will need to establish technical credibility while being "collaborative" rather than "talking at him."

5. **Long-term Commitment**: Jon explicitly asked about commitment to the role, stating that if this were just "a paycheck for the next 3 to 6 months, then that would hurt my reputation." This indicates an expectation of meaningful engagement beyond just filling an immediate need.

## Cultural Dynamics

The interview provided valuable insights into Zenity's cultural dynamics:

1. **Israeli-American Hybrid Culture**: With the CEO (Ben) in New York and the CTO (Michael) in Israel, the company bridges Israeli startup culture with American business practices. Jon specifically mentioned "Israeli culture" as something to be aware of when speaking with the founders.

2. **Technical Leadership**: Michael Bargury was described as "very, very technical," suggesting a culture where technical depth is highly valued. Jon's advice to "go easy on him" and be "more collaborative" indicates a preference for partnership rather than hierarchical approaches.

3. **Startup Chaos**: Jon described Zenity as "a very chaotic environment" where "we don't necessarily know what we need," indicating a fast-paced, sometimes disorganized culture typical of rapidly growing startups.

4. **Founder Mentality**: Jon shared his own perspective that "you never stop being a founder," suggesting an entrepreneurial culture where initiative and ownership are valued.

5. **Acquisition Trajectory**: Jon's candid assessment that "this company gets bought in the next 12-18 months" indicates a strategic orientation toward positioning for acquisition rather than long-term independent growth.

## Enterprise Customer Landscape

The conversation revealed important details about Zenity's customer landscape:

1. **Enterprise Focus**: While Jon mentioned serving "all" market segments, he emphasized that Zenity primarily targets large enterprises, specifically naming Microsoft and American Express as current customers.

2. **Security as Sales Blocker**: Jon described a specific scenario where sales cycles stall at the security review stage, with internal champions unable to override security team requirements. This indicates that security is currently a significant blocker to revenue growth.

3. **Microsoft Ecosystem**: The conversation revealed a strong focus on the Microsoft ecosystem, particularly around Copilot Studio security. This Microsoft orientation is reinforced by the founders' Microsoft background and the strategic investment from Microsoft's M12 venture arm.

4. **Regulated Industry Customers**: The mention of American Express suggests a focus on highly regulated industries with stringent security requirements, where formal security governance is non-negotiable.

5. **Champion-Based Sales Model**: Jon described a sales process that relies on securing internal champions who "really really need this" but lack authority to bypass security reviews, indicating a bottom-up adoption model that eventually requires top-down security approval.

## Implementation Approach

The conversation provided insights into the expected implementation approach:

1. **Pre-Start Preparation**: Vikas emphasized starting "week minus 2" before officially joining, focusing on understanding authority levels and boundaries. This proactive approach resonated with Jon.

2. **Clear Authority Definition**: Vikas stressed the importance of clearly defining what "oversee security" means for each function (sales, engineering, HR, executives), establishing clear expectations from day one.

3. **Relationship Building**: Vikas highlighted the need to build "a pretty good effing relationship with the devops people" and "a really good relationship with the technology people," recognizing that influence will be as important as formal authority.

4. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Vikas proposed identifying immediate risk factors, including deals at risk due to security concerns or investor requirements tied to security milestones.

5. **Efficient Documentation**: Vikas emphasized practical efficiency in documentation, stating "I'm not sitting here spending 3 weeks writing a policy," and mentioned leveraging existing repositories and AI assistance to accelerate deliverables.

## Strategic Value Proposition

The conversation revealed several aspects of the strategic value a CISO would bring to Zenity:

1. **Revenue Acceleration**: Vikas shared a specific example of unlocking $150K in deals at Harness by addressing security requirements, demonstrating the direct revenue impact of effective security leadership.

2. **Acquisition Readiness**: Given Jon's belief that Zenity will be acquired in 12-18 months, a strong security program would enhance valuation and simplify due diligence during acquisition talks.

3. **Scaling Enablement**: As Zenity grows beyond 100 people, formalized security processes become necessary to maintain compliance and operational efficiency.

4. **Competitive Differentiation**: In the AI security market, Zenity's own security posture serves as a demonstration of its expertise, making the CISO role critical to market credibility.

5. **Technical Leadership Support**: A technically credible CISO would complement Michael Bargury's security expertise, allowing him to focus on product innovation while ensuring internal security is properly managed.
